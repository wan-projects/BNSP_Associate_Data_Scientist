# Diabetes Prediction - Associate Data Scientist Certification

## A. Business Objective
Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease that disrupts the bodyâ€™s metabolic process, leading to blood sugar levels that exceed the normal range. Globally, Indonesia ranks 7th in terms of the number of diabetes cases, with a growing trend in the number of patients each year. 

As an associate data scientist, your task is to analyze clinical data of diabetes patients to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements. This analysis is expected to aid doctors in diagnosing and treating the disease.

## B. Technical Objective
The goal is to create classification models to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. Two models are required:
1. **Decision Tree**
2. **Another model of choice** (e.g., Random Forest, SVC, KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, XGBoost)

You are expected to evaluate the performance of the classification models and identify the most important features influencing the prediction of the target variable. The performance of the models will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## C. Success Metrics
The success of the classification model development is defined by achieving an accuracy greater than 70%.

### Model Results:
1. **Decision Tree Accuracy**: 0.7143
2. **Random Forest Accuracy**: 0.7597
3. **SVC Accuracy**: 0.7727
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Accuracy**: 0.7857
5. **Naive Bayes Accuracy**: 0.7273
6. **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: 0.7532
7. **XGBoost Accuracy**: 0.7013

## D. Conclusion
Based on the results, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** achieved the highest accuracy of 0.7857, surpassing the 70% success threshold. Several other models, including **SVC** and **Random Forest**, also performed well. These models provide a strong basis for predictive diagnosis of diabetes, with potential for further tuning and optimization to improve performance.
